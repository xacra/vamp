## Introduction
This book is for both newbies -and experienced programmers (noobs & gurus for short), but if you do not have an open mind about new -or different languages and technology, then you may have a hard time grasping what Vamp is about.

Vamp is an extensible software production and serving platform that offers you the power of any programming language - yet with the simplicity of configuration languages -together with simplified -yet very powerful (and somewhat unorthodox) logic. If you already (somewhat) know languages like JavaScript, C, Lisp, CSS, HTML - then the Vamp language syntax should feel familiar; but bare in mind that it has fundamental differences.

The simplest Vamp program consist of at least 1 folder -which has at least 1 Vamp file inside it. Depending on the file-extensions already registered in your operating system, Vamp file extensions can be any of these: `.v` `.vmp` `.vamp`.

![](../_/img/01.demo_path.png)

Unlike some languages that were just built in a very short while and upgraded over time; Vamp has been carefully planned to fulfill the need of a small yet extensible, fast and expressive core language that can be both a compiled language or an interpreted language -depending how you use it as a developer.

Its core run-time functionality is a `soft-bios` (software basic input output system) which only starts up very basic functionality that can be extended upon. By default installation, the Vamp `dmon` starts at server boot-time and this only happens once. Vamp extensions load (and unload) as they are required by configuration or command.

The Vamp language is: `versatile application meta-programming`. Simply put: you can program anything with Vamp, from simple web-sites, configuration, data-structures, dynamic web applications that span across multiple domains, through to 3D rendering, document processing and even embedded hardware systems. Vamp can translate and compile (trans-pile) between any languages it has transpilers for. By default Vamp comes with transpilers for: plain-text, Markdown, JavaScript, JSON, XML, HTML, CSS, SQL, and ZIP.

Many languages claim to be "simple", but yet when you start learning it things become "not-so-simple" anymore -- Vamp is not this. If a Vamp function or method is not easy to use for any developer (noob -or guru) -then it needs to be changed in order to keep things very simple and straight-forward -yet powerful and flexible. How simple is the simplest Vamp program? --well no programming language is any good without a simple "Hello World!" exercise. See he following screen-shots of the structure and code required for 2 different applications:
<br><br>

#### Simple terminal (TTY) application
The most simple (daft) application you can possibly make in Vamp would be run inside a terminal:
![](../_/img/Screenshot_20161227_112547.png)

When you run this "example.com" project (above) in a terminal, you should see this:
![](../_/img/01.demo_init.png)

Here's how this simple program (above) works:
- Every Vamp project is a "structure".
- Anything in Vamp can be "called" like a function and when you initiate the project, it is "called"
- The `$` file simply means "self" (like "this" in JavaScript) and all it contains (above) is a plain text string.
- By default, anything that is defined inside function context is "echoed" (returned), but you can override this.
- There is no "view" defined for this "function" to be attached to, so it feeds the output to the view that initiated the project.
- The program terminates (exits) automatically because it has no instruction to carry on running as a service.

Everything is explained (in detail) later in this book, the info and examples in this chapter is just to familiarize yourself with Vamp and what you can do with it, stay tuned ;)
<br><br>

##### Simple web-server
The following is a very simple "Hello World!" web server; for all intensive purposes it's useless, but works as expected:
![](../_/img/Screenshot_20161227_115446.png)
By default you need to create/initiate all projects in a terminal (as shown in the terminal screenshot above); after which your projects will automatically start up with Vamp at boot time, unless you `kill` it. This time it won't exit by itself, you need to type: `vamp stop example.com` to shut it down as it disconnects itself from the terminal that launched it. When you start it up as described above, then open a web-browser and visit the IP address of the machine you initiated your Vamp project on; you should see something like this:

![](../_/img/Screenshot_20161227_120835.png)

Here's how this simple web-server works:
- the `Listen` function returns a persistent BIOS construct which is dedicated to the arguments passed when called
- the `( )` context operator pair - directly after a word means to `call`
- the `#http` text is a plain-text `hashtag reference` (hashref) - with special meaning for the function being called
- the `[ ]` overrides the default `Tick` (event) handler sub-routine (function), so you can take control
- the `Hello World!` text implicitly calls `$Echo()` with this text as its only argument

The `Listen` function has default configuration, but it needs to know at least where and what to listen on.
There are various kinds of "plain text" in Vamp, including hashrefs. The hashtag - directly followed by plain-text refers to something that could have "special meaning", but you can define these as you wish, after all, it's just text; however, sometimes you would want to group together some arguments you want to pass to a function - along with other arguments that may (or may not) be related, so, hash-tagging helps because it offers some neat functionality.

When the Vamp dmon starts up at server boot, it checks certain things, like if there is an internet connection by checking 1 (or more) reliable (configured) servers on the net to get your server's own public IP address - together with its IP address in the local network. Having this info ready for your projects is priceless as it saves a lot of time for you (the developer) and it also provides automatic configuration. By default an HTTP web server listens on port `80`, and, the Vamp dmon has to run as `root` - like Apache -- don't worry, Vamp is ***anal*** about security as you will see later on - but this security does not get in your way; it rather compliments any project in a simple yet effective manner.

If port 80 is engaged, it won't run as expected, it will just log this silently in your error log, it will NOT crash.
So, if want it to listen on a different IP or port, it's as simple as e.g:

```vamp
 Listen (#http:127.0.0.1:9000);
```

The code above should be in a file and if this file is directly in your `project root` then the world wide web will have access to all of what is inside this folder - unless you put this file in a different place - like in a sub-folder. You can also specify exactly which paths to serve (and which NOT to serve) and also which kind of files as well as which IP addresses to block -or allow, etc, by editing this `Listen` instance's defaults (even during run-time) specifying what it should be "biased" to or against with the `Deny` and `Auth` properties like this:

```vamp
 Listen (#http)
 {
   Path: [./docs/]
   Bias:
   {
      Deny:
      {
         Addr:
         [
            `192.*`
            `47.*`:
            {
               Path: ./docs/admin/
               Mime: [`pdf`]
            }
         ]
      }
   }
 }
```

The example above explains configuration that only serves contents from the relative path `./docs/` and is biased against certain IP groups; it denies the `./docs/admin/` path -and the `pdf` file extension -only for these IPs. Of course you should have these "Bias" settings in a different file - just to keep everything neat and tidy. You can also override the default behavior per request explicitly by doing something like this:

```vamp
 Listen (#http:192.168.0.1:1234) {Bias:/conf/http/bias.cfg.v}
 [
   (($Echo.Size > 1.Tb) ? `This "\($Path)\" file is actually too big, seriously.`);
   (((`video` @ $Echo.Mime) & ((#date:d)(1~3) = `Mon`)) ? `No movies on Mondays!`);
 ]
```

Don't sweat (too much) about all the code above, everything will be explained (with examples) in the chapters to follow, but here's a few pointers to satisfy your curiosity for now:
- Inside the expression context `( )`, the `?` operator tests "truth", so it's like "really? -well then blah"
- Inside `( )` you can also use `|` (or) -either alone -or after `?` for "else", but it's explained later.
- You can access properties of `$` like this: `$.Echo`, or like this: `$Echo`.
- The `$Echo` construct holds information about the default `return` values - which you can override.
- The `$Echo` construct can also be called (doh) but when its called - the rest is ignored, like `return` in JavaScript.
- The `$Echo` can be invoked (called) implicitly by stating some value; a statement ends with a semicolon `;` (or 2 new-lines).
- Inside the `( )` (call-context) the `$` refers to `self` - which is the `$Echo`, so you need only `$Path` (not `$Echo.Path`).
- In this case - the `$Echo.Size` and `$Echo.Mime` properties are shortcuts to the size and mime-type headers.
- We referred to a number-property `Tb` (unit) which multiplies the number by the number of bytes in a Terabyte.
- The `@` operator "finds" something inside something else - like: "where you at woman?!" :P
- The `#date:d` hash-ref is a shortcut that provides the name of the current day of the week in plain-text.
- Calling text with a list (range) echoes the characters at the positions of the list in order.

References to variables must always be inside `( )` alone, like: `(person)`, or `("Hello " + (person.name))`.
If you refer to a variable that is not defined it will not "crash" at all - instead it will just fill that slot with `Void` - which is a datatype that means "nothingness" -or "undefined".
In text `Void` is automatically replaced by `☐` (unicode BALLOT BOX).
In numbers `Void` is replaced by `0`.
You can "delete" items from a list (or object) by setting their key-names to `Void`, but that is explained later - for now just know that in Vamp there is no such thing as a "null" key-name; if this happens -or if the key-name is an empty text - it will be automatically discarded.

You can `Listen` on many things, server-side as well as client-side. On the server you can also listen for events on links, files, folders, etc -to trigger some function you define as `Tick` (event) handler. See the example mime-type files in the section below for JavaScript "Listen" methods.

##### Awesome (open-source) platform
The Vamp source-code is primarily JavaScript and Vamp; the rest is: C, Fortran and some "glue languages" for platform compatibility and configuration. The compiled Vamp distribution packages are mainly binary and configuration files for you to tweak and even extend the language itself.
The reasons for C and Fortran is primarily to provide well defined internal support for hardware and parallel processing capabilities for stereoscopic screenless displays, mind-and-gesture input devices and quantum computers - more on this later -- Vamp has built-in support for qubits ;)

The Vamp distribution package comes in 3 "flavors": *Standard*, *Business* and *ReSeller*. Only *Standard* is free.
- **Standard - MIT License** - can be used as you want, keep credits, can't sell it, you can get paid for your labor.
- **Business - EULA** - comes with more transpilers, developer training, can be used as you want -except reselling Vamp.
- **ReSeller - VRGL** - Vamp Reseller General License - for if you want to sell Vamp for commercial (Business EULA) use.

The development and publication requirements of Vamp transpiler programmers are to provide the core Vamp language capabilities, such as its `data-types` and sub-routine overrides during run-time. This simply means that Vamp provides the end-user-programmer with the capability to create highly dynamic software systems capable of automatically re-programming itself during run-time (including "functions"); so, you can create software systems that are capable of adapting to its environment, like: load-balancing, resource acquisition, automatic calibration, dynamic configuration, etc. It is understandable that not all languages do the same thing, hence it is not "required" for a language transpiler like e.g: SQL to function as a "programming language" (as mentioned above) -- only that it should comply with the Vamp `data://` protocol specifications (which works like `BSON` as in MongoDB) and that data should be securely transmitted over external connections (encrypted). Any transpiler should just fulfill its role as expected.

All this really means is with Vamp any kind of software development (including "artificial intelligence" applications) become much easier to develop and upgrade -regardless of the language required to interact with any target platforms (microchips, operating systems, web-browsers, etc) - and it can do this "on its own" (if programmed to do so) - and all this can be done in 1 language.

This means that if you want a job at a firm that needs a good `C#` developer (for example) - you can apply for this position and just use Vamp to transpile your work to `C#` -- which will be neat, commented and well structured.

With all the above in mind, you may wonder if maybe these different technologies are separate and have different languages for a good reason? - indeed; however, "best practices" encourage keeping different mime-types in different files, and Vamp files should have primary -and sub-file-extensions. For example they should have file-names that look something like:
- HTML file: `home.html.v`
- CSS file: `style.css.v`
- JSON file: `config.json.v`
- JavaScript file: `events.js.v`

You can also chain these to have more than 2 extensions, for example: if you want to create a folder structure as an ISO file and have the ISO transpiler create the desired output according to the paths inside the Vamp file accordingly, and compress it all together in a ZIP file; the file-name should look something like this: `archive.zip.iso.v`. You can follow how the transpilers will work - backwards:
- `.v` creates a structure from the Vamp language instructions inside this (plain text) file
- `.iso` builds an ISO archive with all the data extracted from simple path-names given inside the Vamp file
- `.zip` compresses the output to the standard ZIP archive format

The output of the above file would be as you'd expect: a zip file, but the `mime`-name-reference (extensions) would be in reverse, unless explicitly instructed to output a different file-name. This helps with backwards compatibility - both for the Vamp transpilers and you (the user or developer); so, in this case the output file-name should be: `archive.v.iso.zip`. So, when this file is reversed back to simple Vamp language - even on a different system, it will extract the data in reverse and build a folder structure on the target file-system in its relative path from where it is extracted - which means it can be altered (even automatically) and re-archived and compressed as mentioned.

Below are 4 examples of what the above-mentioned `html`, `CSS`, `JSON` and `JavaScript` files may look like in Vamp.
Keep in mind that you should always keep client-side and server-side files separate.

**home.html.v**
```vamp
// begin main blah   .. this is just comment
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   html
   [
      head
      [
         title [`home page`]
         link {rel:`stylesheet`, href:`/style.css.v`}
      ]

      body
      [
         h1 [`My awesome site!`]

         a {href:`#`}[`Click Me!`]

         p {id:`FreakyText`} // say whaaat?
         [|
            Finally, I can just type whatever!

            This line will have 2 line-breaks above (in the output) - without `br` tags!
            If you want 1 line-break after the end of a sentence, just do it like here (above this line),
            see, the above sentence ended (!) and this (rather long) sentence started on a new-line and in
            the output it will be so; however if I just continue on a new -line to have my code neat and
            the sentence did not end, then in the output it will just carry on with normal wrapping - on
            the same line as expected.

            Better yet, I can import variables and all kinds of dynamic data in here like \(this)\ - and
            even unicode characters: \263A\ - by default Vamp has the output charset as UTF-8 (which as you
            know is backwards compatible with ASCII).

            BooYAA!!!
         |]
      ] // the text above in the `[| |]` pair is "alternative content", not comment, but this line is :D
   ]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\\ thank you thank you - hold your applause.. burp
```
<br><br>


**style.css.v**
```vamp
// begin some section \\
-------------------------------------------------
   body
   {
      font-family: Arial, Helvitica, Sans; // this is actually a list, but you can type it like this too
      color: #BADA55; // orrr not so badass - its lame-green .. (not lime)
      background: url(that_variable_path_thingy); // yes, you can put variables in here too :P
   }
-------------------------------------------------
\\ ending some section //
```
<br><br>


**config.json.v**
```vamp
// begin some section \\  ... comments in JSON !!
-------------------------------------------------
   person   // we don't need to put everything inside "" (quotes) at all - the transpiler will fix it
   {
      name: `Anna`   // no commas needed, but you can put it in there, it will be fixed in the output
      surname: `Ban..Anna`; // even semi-colons get fixed!
      likes:
      [
         `ice cream`,
         `hoola hoops`  // left this comma out on purpose, but the transpiler fixes that
         `coffee`,   // and this has an extra comma which is also fine whoohoo!!
      ]
   }
-------------------------------------------------
\\ ending some section //
```
<br><br>


**events.js.v**
```vamp

// section \\
-------------------------------------------------
   Listen(#user:click @ `body`)           :: like: document.body.addEventListener('click', (event)=>{...});
   [
      Dump(`\($nodeName)\ was clicked!`); :: like: console.log(event.target.nodeName + 'was clicked!')
   ]
-------------------------------------------------
\\ section //
```

If you know systems development well, you're probably thinking that this is all fine and dandy - but won't this take up a lot of server resources and slow down processing on every request? -- yup BUT (big butt see?) - you can `bake` files that are not supposed to be dynamically transpiled on every request, or set it to be baked automatically on-change; so, the output does not always have to be transpiled on every request; the "baked" file is just served instead.
...told you Vamp is awesome!

## Structure

Vamp does not impose any "structure" upon you. You define your file-structure and Vamp uses it. By design, the Vamp language interpreter cannot read any "absolute system path". This is for security reasons, and it also makes everything a lot simpler, especially concerning portability of your code. This does NOT mean you can't access anything else in your file-system at all - on the contrary -Vamp has a very nifty trick to mount any resource external to your project - anywhere into your project. This may seem a bit strange, so, allow me to elaborate:
<br><br>

##### FileSystem <=> VampCode
Vamp code can be broken down into very small files, where 1 value can be inside a file. This makes it possible to create an entire database with Vamp code alone and have the `devl` (Vamp developer command-line tool) brake it up into more basic parts - as folders and files; -or have it build 1 Vamp file from an entire structure of folders and files. (more on this later).

Your Vamp code and your file-structure are very closely related - relatively to where your project resides on your file-system. In the image below, look how closely a simple folder-structure relates to Vamp code:

![](../_/img/01.path_as_code.png)

From the image above you can see that the `[ ]` operator pair is used as "container" specification and is used as such everywhere, so there is no ambiguity -or confusion. This is how Vamp is designed: to be simple and concise.

If you need access to a different path from where your Vamp project-root resides, or a different file-system, you need to create a relative `sym-link` (either manually, or in your Vamp code) so it can be "mounted" into the current project structure during run-time - as access to it is required in your code; so it won't just load everything all at once, only as requested; even so, it will not clutch and horde everything indefinitely. Vamp also has an automatic resource monitor built into its core, so if the run-time memory becomes 90% full, it will save any unsaved (unpopular) live structure to disk -then unload it out of memory and load the more popular data as needed -- automatically (more on this later).

By using Vamp, you can give `meta-attributes` (properties and methods) to any structure; this includes folders and mounted resources. It uses a very simple `name, attributes, container` structure in the code, but for resources other than Vamp files it stores the attributes information inside the folder itself -or the containing folder of the resource.

This is a very well constructed dynamic structure and it's important to know that your entire structure does NOT get loaded upon initialization, not at all; instead - only the paths & data (relative tree-based data structure) that is requested gets loaded into memory as they are used; and if not used as much then it gets saved to disk to make room for more popular requested (sub-)structures and data. From this you can see that the structure (or part of it) in live memory can be saved to disk (at your command) or automatically and transported to somewhere else where it can become (part of) another live structure - even on another domain -- which makes this methodology extremely flexible, scalable, fast and portable (secure also, keep reading).

It is important to notice that the Vamp structure and language is built around the principles of a very fast database system which is your project. Paths are related -biased against root-concepts (folders directly in root) and its children -not to edit anything else outside of its own tree structure - unless authorization (configuration) is given. This means your business logic and data model are the same thing; which simplifies things; but you can of coarse separate these if you want to, it's up to you.

Throughout this book it is expected that you work on a "unix-like" project server, so file-system paths look like URLs which start with something like: `/foo/bar` -or `./flerb/bark`. When you code any file-system "path" and you start it with `/` then it will NOT look in your actual file-system "root" at all, but it will instead start looking in your project-root; see below.
<br><br>

#### Project Root
As mentioned above, your "project root" is simply a folder where you want your Vamp project to reside. When you want a new Vamp project, you can tell the Vamp `devl` to make it from your terminal (command line interface -simply: CLI)
like this:

```
 coder@desk~> vamp make dmon /srv/example.com
```

All vamp CLI commands work as you see from the above `CLI` command, and here's how it works:
- `vamp` is an executable command accessible to the user that installed it (more on this later)
- `make` is a command that is passed onto the Vamp `devl` (developer service)
- `dmon` describes to make this a process of its own (a service) that will start up and run with Vamp
- `/srv/example.com` is the absolute file-system path to your project-root folder (directory)

From the above you can follow: `vamp -> action -> arguments`.

If the path `/srv/example.com` does not exist, the Vamp `devl` service will create it, but if it already exists it will be re-instated (if killed for example).
To `kill` a Vamp project is not the same as to "kill" a process in Linux; what it actually does is: if the process is running - it will get killed and also unregistered not to start again at server boot-time.
Once `make dmon` this is done, the `devl` service indexes this path with the name of this project (the folder name); so from here onward you can issue commands to the project name directly without the absolute path. You cannot have projects with the exact same name. Everything in Vamp is case-sensitive in the CLI as well as in your Vamp (language) code.

So from here on you can issue commands like the following:
```
 coder@desk~> vamp init example.com
 Starting: `example.com`                                                                  [done]

 coder@desk~> vamp stop example.com
 Stopping: `example.com`                                                                  [done]

 coder@desk~> vamp make docs example.com /home/coder/docs/example.com.pdf
 Creating PDF documentation for `example.com`                                             [done]

 coder@desk~> vamp drop example.com
 Really delete `/srv/example.com` ?  (y/n) y
 killing: `example.com`                                                                   [done]
 deleting: `/srv/example.com`                                                             [done]
```

If you pass the `init` command on a project that is already initiated, the project will automatically be stopped and started (restart). As you've noticed you can have `vamp docs` make documentation from the comments in your code, and this makes really well formatted documentation for you - granted that you comment your code properly.

Vamp has many kinds of comments for you to use in order to make your code look neat and also provide awesome documentation - together with colored (highlighted) tags like `TODO`, `HACK`, `FAIL` etc - which will only show as highlighted and well formatted in the resulting documentation. In the document-comment blocks you can use standard (Github) Markdown language.

When you are inside your project run-time context, you cannot access any other path deeper than your project-root. This is by design for operating system security and project-contents portability. As mentioned above, you can create symbolic links to other resources. These sym-links can also have special instructions in its target path (URI) - even for different protocols that pass authentication credentials for internal -or external services, like FTP, SSH, etc and these become part of your project structure during run-time as accessed.

Creating these special sym-links in your operating system manually may be a challenge, so you can also create these special sym-links in your CLI like this:
```
 coder@desk~> vamp make path example.com/pics/ file://user:pass@/home/coder/wallpaper
 coder@desk~> vamp make path example.com/info.json http://user:pass@fubar.com/stuff.json
 coder@desk~> vamp make path example.com/users/ data://user:pass@fubar.com/userdb/staff.mysql
```

In the example above we created 3 mount points in the project-root directly:
- the 1st: `pics` is a symlink that points to a folder in the local file-system
- the 2nd: `info.json` is a special kind of symlink that points to a `JSON` file on another server
- the 3rd: `users` is very special as it provides Vamp (structure) access to a remote `mysql` database table

Note that the same kind of URL structure is used for any protocol. The Vamp `devl` (service) will use the methods and URLs expected for the remote resource, but you don't have to worry about that, as long as the URL has the authentication credentials as in the examples above, it will work as expected.

The last (3rd) example above may seem strange, so, allow me to explain:
With Vamp you can create any "protocol" you want, as long as you obey the "rules" of the connection to "the other end". The "mime-type" in Vamp is very important and these can be defined -or edited as you wish, but by default Vamp comes with some strong kung-fu. The `.mysql` extension in the 3rd example tells the Vamp "bios" that you will be translating information via "mysql" standards and in turn you can transmit information from and to these remote resources as you would work with any resources locally in your project. Note that in this 3rd example above we selected the "userdb" database and only 1 table: "staff". We did not have to select the "staff" table, we could've just selected the "userdb" and then its tables would have been available in your project as "folders". You can also connect to a local database the same way as above.

## Arithmetic Expressions
Besides the pure awesomeness of Vamp's BIOS and integrated structure, this introduction will not be complete without telling you about Vamp's unusual (but powerful) expressions. By this I don't mean "regular expressions" (which is also built into Vamp and works exactly like JavaScript's Regex) -but the Vamp expression context gives you so much power with so little effort - and you don't need to break your brain in order to understand them. Allow me to elaborate:

You've probably seen that in JavaScript you use `+` to concatenate strings (plain text) or strings with numbers. Vamp takes this to a whole new level by using arithmetic operators so that you can do data-manipulation like a genius on nootropics!
The following code sample is some examples of things you can do, and the comments will explain - hold onto your seat!

```vamp
   (`abcdef` + 9)       .: abcdef9        :: added 9 at the end of the text
   (9 + `abcdef`)       .: 9abcdef        :: added text after the 9
   (`abcdef` - 3)       .: abc            :: it subtracted 3 characters from the end
   (-3 + `abcdef`)      .: def            :: the negative void swallowed 3 characters at the beginning
   (`abcdef` * -1)      .: fedcba         :: turned the text to the negative of itself - reversed it
   (`abcdef` / 2)       .: [abc,def]      :: split the text in 2 - resulting in a list

   ([a] + b)            .: [a,b]          :: added b at the end of the list
   (b + [a])            .: [b,a]          :: added b to the beginning
   ([a,b,c] - 2)        .: [a]            :: subtracted 2 items from the end
   (-2 + [a,b,c])       .: [c]            :: the negative void swallowed 2 items at the beginning
   ([a,b,c] * -1)       .: [c,b,a]        :: reversed it
   ([a,b,c] / 2)        .: [[a,b],[c]]    :: split the list into 2 lists
   ([c] + [a,b])        .: [c,a,b]        :: concatenate in order
   ([a,b,c].1)          .: a              :: first item in the list .. in Vamp array indices start at 1, not 0 .. the `( )` is not required, but harmless
   ([a,b,c].0)          .: c              :: last item in the list 
   ([a,b,c,d,e] <- 1)   .: [b,c,d,e,a]    :: rotate array 1 item to the left 
   ([a,b,c,d,e] -> 1)   .: [e,a,b,c,d]    :: rotate array 1 item to the right 
   (["a","b"] * [1,2])  .: {a:1,b:2}      :: combine 2 arrays into object - left operand for keys, right for values
   ({a:1,b:2} % {})     .: ["a","b"]      :: expose keys
   ({a:1,b:2} % [])     .: [1,2]          :: expose values
   ({a:1,b:2} % #Flip)  .: {1:"a",2:"b"}  :: modified the object with #Flip hashref .. flipped it inside-out

   (9 / 0)              .: 9              :: unchanged .. sliced with nothing
   (0 / 0)              .: 0              :: unchanged
   (5 ^ 0)              .: 1              :: same as (5 / 5)
   (0 ^ 0)              .: 0              :: same as (0 / 0)
```

Even though the first 2 sections in the code above makes some sense (in a non mathematician way) - you can see how it saves you a lot of learning - unlike in many other languages with "substr()" -or "shift()" - or "pop()" -- but you don't need any of that in Vamp once you "get" these expressions - you can code some awesome stuff with little effort.
The last section (above) may raise some heavy questions as "division by zero" has not been dealt with in a numerical way; see below:
```vamp
.: division by ZERO yields unchanged :.
-- ------------------------------------

     1               0
    --- X 1   =/=   --- X 2
     0               0

-- ------------------------------------
:: this equation (above) yields true ::


:: The following are simplified equations of the above, granted that division by zero yields: unchanged

 ((1 * 1) != (0 * 2))  .: true
 (1 != 0)              .: true

.: problem solved
```

It is not expected that the above "division by zero" theory should be accepted in mathematics; it only means that your programming will NOT break into "not a number" (NaN) -and  will not result in some mathematical fallacies; so your programming logic can flow dynamically without such worries. The same goes for the `IEEE` standards as seen in many programming (and scripting) languages, such as JavaScript. The following explains:
```vamp
// JavaScript
// ­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­--------------------
   (0.1 + 0.2)             //    0.30000000000000004     wtf?
   ((0.1 + 0.2) == 0.3)    //    false                   kill me now!
// ­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­--------------------


:: VAMP
­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­-----------------------
   (0.1 + 0.2)             .:    0.3
   ((0.1 + 0.2) = 0.3)     .:    true
­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­-----------------------
```

The above example shows how Vamp handles this internally by checking the expression values and calculates the expected result accordingly. This saves you a bunch of headaches - especially in output to the end user - when "no bs" is concerned.

### Data (crud) operations

Here are some examples on how to do simple CRUD operations on any data (folders & files or mounted databases).
Just remember that anything in your Vamp code is related to its current context - file path including.

```vamp

// create \\
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Create(users:{[name,mail,pass,age,likes,note]});      .: creates a container with a list of containers

:: you can also create as above (even by path) -and insert data in one go like this:

   Create(/data/users:{[name,mail,pass,age,likes,note]})
   [
      [ `Julie`, `julez@imail.me`, `s0L0v3d`, 29, [`Donny`,`fruit`,`movies`], `I'm available` ]
      [ `Donny`, `donno@mgtow.it`, `f0cus3d`, 34, [`Julie`,`music`,`coding`], `This is awesome!` ]
   ]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\\ create //



// insert \\
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Insert(users)
   [
      [ `Serene`, `serin@imail.me`, `n3wb0rn`, 28, [`travel`,`hiking`,`art`], `no comment` ]
   ]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\\ insert //



// detail \\
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Detail(#list:cols @ users)                               .:    [name,mail,pass,age,likes,note]
   Detail(#span:cols @ users)                               .:    6
   Detail(#span:rows @ users)                               .:    3
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\\ detail //



// select \\
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Select(users:[name])                                     .:    [Julie,Donny,Serene]
   Select(users:[name] @ 1)                                 .:    [Julie]
   Select(users:[name] @ [2,3])                             .:    [Donny,Serene]
   Select(users:[name] @ (1~3))                             .:    [Julie,Donny,Serene]
   Select(users:[name] @ (#mail = `serin@imail.tv`))        .:    [Serene]
   Select(users:[name] @ (#mail ~ `*imail.me`))             .:    [Julie,Serene]
   Select(users:[name] @ [(#age > 28), (#mail ~ `*mg*`)])   .:    [Donny]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\\ select //
```

You can also use `Create(./foo/bar:'data://user:pass@fubar.com/userdb/staff.mysql');` in your Vamp code without resorting to the CLI as shown earlier.
Remember that `symlinks` can also exist as part of your data -as a column or some value that points to anywhere else (even on another domain); that's the power and beauty of this live structure. This capability -together with the relationships and authorization config of any link/file/folder makes all this come to life. With all this in mind, remember that you can also `Listen` on any event of anything in your project, like when something is accessed, updated, modified - then have it automatically trigger some (chain) reaction throughout your entire project - even with your mounted (symlinked) resources. All this can be dynamically changed during run-time -- that is if you program it to do so.

Vamp is the ***next generation*** open-source rapid-development software platform that is not bound to any rigid language -or imposed structure; which means that: with Vamp you can even (easily) create your very own programming language.

As you can probably see by now - Vamp gives you super powers! (in a geek way) - and runs pretty darn fast (regarding all the goods under the hood). The runtime speed is comparible to NodeJS. There is much more to elaborate on everything discussed so far; however, the purpose of this introduction was only to get you familiar with some Vamp terminology and what the language looks like.

From here on everything is explained in much better detail - step by step - from installation through to creating an immersive cyber-lounge called "AfterLife" which includes automated profile creation via social-networking integration, email, database, geo-location, text-chat, music, file sharing, and video conferencing -- all in a **stereoscopic 3D** graphical user interface. All this may seem like a lot of work, but it's not; Vamp has a LOT of pre-built (customizable) goods to offer and these only get loaded as they are referenced in your project - so stuff you don't need never gets loaded when your project initiates, making your project development and runtime **as fast as possible**.

..so, grab some liquid refreshment and chewables - it's about to get heavy!
